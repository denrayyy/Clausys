## Installation

### Prerequisites
- Node.js (v14 or higher)
- MongoDB (v4.4 or higher)
- npm or yarn

### Backend Setup

1. Navigate to the project root directory
2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. Create a `.env` file in the root directory:
   ```env
   MONGO_URI=mongodb://localhost:27017/classroom_utilization
   PORT=5000
   JWT_SECRET=your-super-secret-jwt-key
   NODE_ENV=development
   ```

4. Initialize the admin account:
   ```bash
   npm run init-admin
   ```
   This creates the pre-configured admin account with:
   - Email: clausys@admin.buksu
   - Password: admin123 (change on first login)

5. Start the backend server:
   ```bash
   npm run server
   ```

### Frontend Setup

1. Navigate to the client directory:
   ```bash
   cd client
   ```

2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. Start the React development server:
   ```bash
   npm start
   ```

### Running Both Servers

From the root directory, run:
```bash
npm run dev
```

This will start both the backend server (port 5000) and frontend server (port 3000) concurrently.

## Admin Account Setup

The system comes with a pre-created admin account for system administration:

**Admin Credentials:**
- Email: `clausys@admin.buksu`
- Password: `admin123`
- Employee ID: `ADMIN001`
- Department: `Administration`

**Important Security Notes:**
1. Change the default password immediately after first login
2. The admin account has full system access
3. Only authorized personnel should have admin access
4. Use the `npm run init-admin` command to create the admin account if it doesn't exist

**Instructor Registration:**
- Instructors can self-register using the registration form
- They need to provide their employee ID and department
- All instructor accounts are automatically assigned the "teacher" role
- Admin approval may be required depending on system configuration
